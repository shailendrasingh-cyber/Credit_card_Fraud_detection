Credit Card Fraud Detection with Machine Learning
Protecting sensitive financial transactions is of paramount importance in today's digital age. Welcome to the Credit Card Fraud Detection project, a robust solution powered by Machine Learning that safeguards against fraudulent credit card activities. This repository hosts a comprehensive analysis and model deployment for detecting credit card fraud with accuracy exceeding 90%.

Key Features
Accurate Fraud Detection: Leverage the power of Machine Learning with three distinct algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and Decision Tree Classifier. Achieve over 90% accuracy in identifying fraudulent credit card transactions.

Data Preprocessing: Implement data preprocessing techniques to ensure that the machine learning models are trained on clean and reliable data.

Model Evaluation: Thoroughly evaluate the performance of each model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Model Deployment: Deploy the best-performing model in a real-world scenario to monitor and detect fraudulent transactions in real-time.

Interactive Visualization: Utilize interactive visualizations to gain insights into the dataset and understand the distribution of legitimate and fraudulent transactions.
